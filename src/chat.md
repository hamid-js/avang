2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and choose "New repository".
3. Enter a name for your repository and choose its visibility (public or private).
4. Click on the "Create repository" button.

Step 2: Set up your React project for deployment

1. In your local project directory, open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to create a production-ready build of your React app:
   ```
   yarn build
   ```
   or
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   This will create an optimized build of your app in a folder named "build".

Step 3: Publish your React app to GitHub Pages

1. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root of your project directory.
2. Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:
   ```
   git init
   ```
3. Add the remote repository URL of the GitHub repository you created earlier using the following command:
   ```
   git remote add origin <repository-url>
   ```
4. Add all the project files to the Git repository:
   ```
   git add .
   ```
5. Commit the changes to the repository:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
6. Push the committed changes to the "gh-pages" branch of your GitHub repository:
   ```
   git push origin master:gh-pages
   ```
   Note: This assumes that your default branch is "master". If your default branch is different, replace "master" with your branch name.

Step 4: Configure GitHub Pages settings

1. Open your GitHub repository in a web browser.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab near the top-right corner.
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
4. Choose the branch "gh-pages" as the source for GitHub Pages.

   "homepage": "http://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>",
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with your GitHub username and `<repository-name>` with the name of your GitHub repository.

Step 3: Deploy your React app
